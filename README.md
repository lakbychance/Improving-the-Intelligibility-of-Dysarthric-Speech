# Improving-the-Intelligibility-of-Dysarthric-Speech

Dysarthria is a speech disorder that results in the disturbances in muscular control over the speech mechanism due to the damage of the central or peripheral nervous system. Dysarthric patients are characterized by slow or slurred speech that is difÔ¨Åcult to understand. Individuals with dysarthria have problems in oral communication due to the reduced speech intelligibility. This invariably calls for techniques to improve the intelligibility of the dysarthric speech.

There have been many studies on intelligibility enhancement of dysarthric speech; most research has focused on developing systems to improve the quality of dysarthric speech, which can be used as an assisting device for people with communicative disabilities.

Although these enhancement techniques do improve the intelligibly the improvement is only good enough for a very specific group of individuals with mild severity of Dysarthria and is often gender bias. These techniques also use transformation techniques that do not preserve the natural prosody of speech and extra-linguistic information such as emotions. Extra-linguistic information are a very important part of nonverbal communication between individuals.

Therefore this project aims to tackle this problem by developing a system which significantly improves the intelligibility of Dysarthric speech in general using machine learning techniques in python while doing so in a way that preserve the natural prosody of speech and extra-linguistic information. Python, being open source, is to be used to implement these models as it provides the user with a vast variety of libraries for audio processing and machine learning. It is also best suited for implementing in real world applications.

This project therefore would highly beneficial for patients suffering from Dysarthria who must travel into a city by public transportation, talk to their friends and family and overall help them interact more with the world around them by lifting the barrier of speech that the Dysarthria imposes on them.
